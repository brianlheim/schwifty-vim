schwifty-vim
============

Fork of Apple's [swift/utils/vim](https://github.com/apple/swift) by Brian Heim. Original
maintainer: Joe Groff.

The indent file is taken from [keith/swift.vim](https://github.com/keith/swift.vim), which is
licensed under the MIT license.

The remainder of this repository - Apple's files and my modifications - are Apache-2.0 licensed.
Where modifications have been made, I have left a notice at the top of the file.

I made this fork because I was dissatisfied by the other Swift/Vim integrations out there (either
too bulky or not quite there yet), and wanted to move faster than Apple's review process would
allow.
